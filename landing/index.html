                        <p class="text-large text-thin">
Before deciding on a career in law, my commitment to social justice had led me to work and volunteer with disadvantaged families and incarcerated individuals in New York state, where I obtained my B.C. in political science from Vassar College in 1987.  Studying law seemed like a natural evolution – a way to develop skills to advance issues I already cared about.  I obtained a law degree from Montreal’s McGill university in 1993.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
Working on a large, litigated indigenous land claim at the start of my legal career awakened my interest in early BC history and my commitment to working with First Nations seeking redress for historical injustices, many of which reverberate through their communities to the present day. Since 2001, I have practiced exclusively in the area of Specific Claims, assisting First Nations and law firms with the research, preparation, negotiation and litigation of claims against Canada.  I am as passionate today about my work as I was 25 years ago when I began practicing law.

        _________________________________________________________ -->

            <div class="section text-gray" id="section2">

                    <div class="col-md-12">

                        <h2 class="title">Specific Claims</h2>


<p class="text-large text-thin">
Specific Claims do not address Aboriginal rights or title, which are inherent to First Nations and which First Nations claimed and enjoyed in their ancestral lands well before colonization.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
Instead, Specific Claims address specific obligations that the Crown assumed in relation to First Nations once the Crown colonized British Columbia.  Specific Claims seek to hold the Crown accountable for its failure to fulfill these obligations - typically the obligations to honour Treaty promises (e.g. Douglas Treaties, Barricade Treaties), to reserve land for First Nations’ continued use and occupation, and to administer and manage reserves lawfully.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
Specific Claims are directed against the federal government because when British Columbia became part of Canada in 1871, it was the federal government, not the Province, that assumed the Colonial Crown’s liabilities, “the charge of the Indians, and the trusteeship and management of the lands reserved for their use and benefit” (Article 13 of the Terms of Union), and the legislative control over “Indians and lands reserved for the Indians” (section 91(24) of the Canadian Constitution).
</p>

<p class="text-large text-thin">
Some Specific Claims address the Crown’s failures during the colonial period (pre-1871), such as:
</p>

<dl>
  <li>the failure to reserve traditional village site and protect these sites from appropriation by settlers, in contravention of colonial policy and law.</li>
  <li>the illegal reduction or elimination of reserves that had been set aside for First Nations in the Colony.</li>
  <li>the failure to honour the terms of the Douglas Treaties on Vancouver Island.</li>
</dl>


<p class="text-large text-thin">
Other Specific Claims address the Crown’s wrongdoing after 1871, when British Columbia became part of Canada.  Some post-1871 Specific Claims deal with the Crown’s failure, in the process of creating reserves:
</p>

<dl>
  <li>to include in reserves, after proper inquiry and consultation, the lands that First Nations habitually used and occupied.</li>
  <li>to recover village or reserve lands that settlers had appropriated unlawfully.</li>
  <li>to represent First Nations’ interests and support their applications for additional lands before the Royal Commission on Indian Affairs (1912-1916).</li>
  <li>to survey reserves properly, so as to include all of the lands that had been intended for inclusion.</li>
</dl>


<p class="text-large text-thin">
Many post-1871 Specific Claims relate to the Crown’s failure in the administration of reserves, once established, such as:
</p>

<dl>
  <li>the failure to ensure that the expropriation of reserve lands for public purposes (road, railway line, hydro line etc...) met the requirements of the Indian Act, minimally impaired the Reserve, and resulted in proper compensation to the affected First Nation.</li>
  <li> the failure to ensure that First Nations were properly compensated for the timber removed from their reserves, and that the sale of the timber and logging operations complied with the requirements of the federal Timber Regulations (cruise and valuation, scaling site, call for tenders).</li>
  <li> the failure to ensure that the use/occupation, lease or disposition of reserve lands was legal and resulted in proper compensation to the affected First Nation.</li>
  <li>the failure to protect the water allocation some First Nations received with their reserves, to obtain reserve-related water records from the Province, and to represent First Nations’ water rights before the provincial Water Board.</li>
  <li>the failure to meet its obligations when effecting the division of a First Nation and the reallocation of its reserves and assets, or when dealing with First Nations’ joint entitlement to reserve lands.  </li>
</dl>

                        <h2 class="title">The Specific Claims Process</h2>

                        <div class="row">


<p class="text-large text-thin">
There are two significant advantages to the Specific Claims process:  it allows First Nations to seek a resolution for historical claims that would otherwise be “time-barred” (too old) to address through the courts, and; federal grant funding is available for the research and preparation of Specific Claims.  TerraVita Law applies for this funding yearly on its clients’ behalf.
</p>

<p class="text-large text-thin">
The process of addressing a Specific Claim is as follows:
</p>

<dl>

<p class="text-large"><strong>Identification/Research of the Claim</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
    The identification of potential claims is informed by the recollections/concerns of the First Nation’s Council, registered reserve transactions, historical documents pertaining to the First Nation’s reserves, and previously-rejected claims (to be resubmitted on stronger facts and/or updated law).  Once the Specific Claim has been identified, TerraVita Law instructs a researcher/historian to retrieve all evidence that might inform and support the Claim.
</p>



<p class="text-large"><strong>Preparation of Legal Opinion</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
    Once the Claim has been fully researched, TerraVita Law prepares the legal opinion, which includes a historical report with supporting documents, an analysis of the Crown’s obligations, and an analysis of how these obligations were breached.
</p>



<p class="text-large"><strong>Submission to First Nation and to Canada</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
    Once the Claim has been completed, it is submitted to Council for its review and for the BCR authorizing the Claim’s submission to Canada.
</p>


<p class="text-large"><strong>Canada’s ‘Minimum Standards’ review</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
  (TODO: look for non-ASCII characters to see if strange things are occurring...)
    Canada undertakes a review of the Claim to ensure its compliance with technical requirements (the Claim contains legal arguments for each allegation; a statement of the facts supporting the allegations; properly-sourced documents; a list of authorities etc…).
</p>



<p class="text-large"><strong>Filing with the Minister: 3-year wait begins</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
    Once a Claim has met Minimum Standards, it is filed with the Minister.  Canada has three years from the filing date to accept or reject the Claim.  During that time, Canada undertakes its own research and legal analysis of the Claim.
</p>


<p class="text-large"><strong>Canada’s response 3 years from filing</strong></p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
<strong>Acceptance:</strong> negotiations begin to arrive at a settlement (some funding available to support negotiations)
</p>
<p class="text-large text-thin">
<strong>Rejection:</strong> First Nation can take the Claim to the Specific Claims Tribunal for a binding resolution (some funding available for the Tribunal process).  Both First Nations and Canada have the right to seek a review of the Tribunal’s decision by the Federal Court of Appeal (and, further, the Supreme Court of Canada).
